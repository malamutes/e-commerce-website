the file structure for new next js apps with app directory is in the form:

/app -> /ROUTEFOLDERNAME -> /page.tsx

where inside page.tsx will be content of route page, this is so next js
can automatically tell that oh ROUTEFOLDERNAME is /root/someroute and /page.tsx is its main content

but for backedn stuff they still need ot be inside pages/api i think?

 content: [
    "./src/pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
  ],

  the /pages/componetns is for legacy next js whereas now /app is enough since everything is in there
